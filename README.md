# number-converter
It is program for converting decimal number to binary. In this I have used html, css, and vanilla-javascript for frontend.

Hello, I am Aditya Abhinav and during this frontend project and i will try to use css frameworks like bootstrap and tailwind.
And for logic we will use vanilla Javascript.

First we will understand how can we convert a decimal number to binary one :-

 First take a number and start divide it by 2.

 for ex : - 9 is divided by 2 we get remainder 1.

 then we get 4 as quotient and again we will divide it by 2.

 this time we will remainder as 0.

 again we get 2 as quotient and after dividing it by 2 we get 0 as remainder;

 again we get 1 as quotient

 so if we see we get stack of remainders as follows:-

 > 1 <br>
 > 0 <br>
 > 0 <br>
 > 1 ( this is last quotient we get)

 now we got our binary number of 9 just we need to rearrange the stack of numbers above from downside to upside 👍

 > result is 1001
